# Campus-Placement-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
## Overview
This project aims to predict campus placement outcomes using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, and demographic details, the model predicts the likelihood of a student being placed in a job after graduation. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.
